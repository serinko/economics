COUNTING PROFIT and LOSS

As we understand how the formula of PnL works, we will try to put it in practice. I recommend to use a calculator and an empty text document or a peace of paper for the side notes and final numbers, so ones mind can stay focused on the steps, not on holding too many numbers together. This helps to prevent mistakes.

Let's try to put it in practice: 

1 - Have a look on the potfolio, there is a coin called $COPE. For the practice - imagie that we have decided that we will hold this coin until it has a value of $10000. What is the exit price on the market, we are looking for to exit on (or set a take profit SELL order)?

2 - There are news that Turkey is invading Greece and however the EU and NATO do not really react as "expected", they announce a lot of economical sanctions. We concluded $TRYB will fall because of that. 
Entering - opening a SHORT position at a price of $0.0715 - for $1500. We decided following targets: that we will close one half of our position when $TRYB drops 40% and the rest, when it drops 50% from our entry. What will be our profit in total (on top of the 1500$ investment).

3 - Actually I made a mistake in the excercise number 1. It is slightly bit complicated. We are looking to withraw 10000 in total, just like in the excercise number 1, but in EURO, in CASH. The market though is only in COPE/USD. To get it in cash, we will use an ATM to have it not connected to our bank accounts. an ATM takes 3.5% and allows only 900E withdrawls per transaction. Each transaction charges 10E on top of the 3.5%. If our aim is to have 10000E in cash in the end of this investment, what is the price to exit the COPE/USD market. Giving the anticipation that the ratio of USD/EUR stays the same as it's today.
