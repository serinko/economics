COUNTING PROFIT and LOSS

As we understand how the formula of PnL works, we will try to put it in practice. I recommend to use a calculator and an empty text document or a peace of paper for the side notes and final numbers, so ones mind can stay focused on the steps, not on holding too many numbers together. This helps to prevent mistakes.

Let's try to put it in practice: 

1 - Have a look on our potfolio, there is a coin called $COPE. For the practice - imagie that we have decided that we will hold this coin until it has a value of $10000. What is the exit price on the market, we are looking for to exit on (or set a take profit SELL order)?
