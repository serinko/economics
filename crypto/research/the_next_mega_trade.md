# The next mega-trade
## notes from article
##### Original article:
https://panteracapital.com/blockchain-letter/the-next-mega-trade/

* Fed has manipulated the US Treasury and bond market 
* They printed a lot of money and are now trying to counter inflation
* The bubble is bursting, they will raise the interest on bonds
* Raise of inflation and how central banks respond is believed to be a big theme of 2022 
* The debt in US is ~$30 trillion or $250 000 per family
* There are 3.6 million more jobs then there are unemployed
* Employment number is the lowest in 45 year
* Crypto correlates with macro markets for 70 days. That's why crypto is down now
* crypto market will be back in a few weeks to a couple of months and trade independently again 
* What is happening will kill bonds, but not blockchain bcs it's not cashflow oriented
* Btc only spent 12.7% of history under trend. Odds high that btc will be back quick.
* Ppl will turn to crypto
* Prices fall leading up to tax day (which is April 18th) bcs ppl sell crypto to be able to pay tax
* We buy when there is upgoing trend. A lot of investors buy btc when it's trading well above trend. 
* Now when it's down is the time to buy. Only 13% of the past 11 years has the market been this cheap 
or cheaper. 

* The author of the article created Pantera bitcoin fund and Pantera blockchain fund
- The fund is a venture fund - they invest in illiquid assets and early stage token projects.
- Co-investment is $15mm or more (at least 10% of each venture and early stage token deal) 
* There's LP (limited partnership, little to not control over management, my note) investments and chances 
for deals. 
* They also invested in Aurora, bridge for:
NEAR smart contracts

* NEAR protocol is open-source, proof-of-stake and horizontal scaling
<i>"adding more hardware to the blockchain network, and having each node in the network perform only a 
subset of the overall work. This includes blockchains that have a multi-chain design, such as Cosmos, in 
which different applications create their own blockchain. It also includes sharding, which separates the 
blockchain into multiple smaller ones, all sharing the same block structure and consensus. This is how 
L1s like Ethereum, NEAR, and Harmony plan to improve scalability going forward."</i>
* and invested in Arbitrum

#### Why web3 matters
* Composability - when developers build on blockchain all assets and content are shared which allows 
developers to build off each other and innovate in way which wasn't possible in web2. 
* assets owned by users, which is a powerful incentive - instead of centralized ownership

#### Metaverse
* It's difficult to predict how it will develop. Right now, it's far from mainstream 
* So far, there are crypto and non-crypto metaverses
* Believe that crypto metaverse will beat the enterprises, but it is a future that needs to be built. 
* Metaverse need own infrastructure ie. decentralized messing and management tools

##### Non-crypto
* Facebook (now Meta) and Microsoft incorporated metaverse into roadmap

##### Crypto
* Virtual worlds such as: Sandbox, Decentraland, Cryptovoxels
* users in the virtual worlds bought land to make PR for goods and host events

#### Play to earn 
* Play to earn is blockchain-based gaming, earning money based on in-game activity
* Sometimes players need to make an investment before they can play ie. own a team 
* Companies profit from this by borrowing assets to players and taking part of earnings 

* See crypto currencies as the foundation of a new financial infrastructure 
* Crypto and internet users - though starting at different time - following each other in increase though 
crypto generates more value

* Bitcoin have the potential to disrupt traditional banking
