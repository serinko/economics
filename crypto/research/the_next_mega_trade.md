# The next mega-trade
## notes from article


* Fed's manipulated US Treasury and bond market. They printed a lot of money and are now trying 
to counter inflation by raising the interest on bonds. 
* Crypto correlates with macro markets for 70 days. This is why crypto is down.
* Crypto market will be back in a few weeks to a couple of months and trade independently again. 
* This will kill bonds, but not blockchain because its not cashflow oriented.
* BTC only spent 12.7% of history under trend. Odds are high that BTC will be back quick.
* A lot of people will turn to crypto
* Value of crypto assets will fall leading up to tax day (which is April 18th) because ppl sell 
crypto to be able to pay tax
* Most people buy when there is an upgoing trend. A lot of investors buy BTC when it's trading well 
above trend. Now is the time to buy. Only 13% of the past 11 years has the market been this cheap or cheaper.
