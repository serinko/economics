# COUNTING PROFIT and LOSS

As we understand how the formula of PnL works, let's to put it in practice. I recommend to use a calculator
and an empty text document or a piace of paper for the side notes and final numbers, 
so ones mind can stay focused on the steps, not on holding too many numbers together. 
This helps to prevent mistakes. 

If you familiar with Python basics, open terminal and use that. Storing numbers under variables to recall them later, or build entire functions for calculation makes this work much easier!

## Excercises
Practice on the following imaginery scenerios your counting

**1.**

There is a coin/token called $TOKEN. $Token today cost $1.825 and you hold onto 
1758 coins. You decided to hold this asset until it has a value of $10000. 

What is the exit price on the market, we are looking for to exit on (or set a take profit limit - SELL order)?


**2.**

There are news that Turkey is invading Greece and however the EU and NATO do not really react as "expected", 
they announce a lot of economical sanctions. You concluded $TRYB will fall because of that. And honestly you wanna help it a bit too.

Entering - opening a SHORT position at a price of $0.0715 - for $1500. You decide on following targets: 
* close one half of our position when $TRYB drops 40% from the entry
* close the rest of the position when $TRYB draws 50% from the entry 

**Count:**
a) What will be the Take profit points (the exit price marks)?
b) What will be our total profit (on top of the 1500$ investment)?
c) If the price action will go against us, you decide to accept risk exposure of losses $300, 
Whats the $TRYB price then to set a stop loss - exit strategy?


**3.**
Excercise #1 seems to be actually more complicated. The target is not to close position in $10000 value, but to withdraw 10000. 

*Except:*

* In Euro, not in USD - use todays ratio to count how much $ is our target then
* In CASH! The market though is only in $TOKEN/USD. To get it in cash, we will use an ATM. ATM takes 5% fee and allows only 900E withdrawls per 
transaction. Each transaction charges 10E fixed fee on top of the 5% fee. If the objective is to have 10000E in cash 
in the end of this investment, what is the price to exit the COPE/USD market. Giving the anticipation that the ratio 
of USD/EUR stays the same as it's today, the limit per tx and added fees...
* Account for all the fees and exchange ratio and re-asses the exit take profit limit $TOKEN/USD price.
