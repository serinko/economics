COUNTING PROFIT and LOSS - RESULTS


1 - Have a look on the potfolio, there is a coin called $COPE. For the practice - imagie that we have decided 
that we will hold this coin until it has a value of $10000. What is the exit price on the market, 
we are looking for to exit on (or set a take profit SELL order)?

$COPE ammount = 2809.06
target $10000
Price of $COPE to close position = 10000/2809.06
Exit price of $COPE for this position is $3.56



2 - There are news that Turkey is invading Greece and however the EU and NATO do not really react as "expected", 
they announce a lot of economical sanctions. We concluded $TRYB will fall because of that. 
Entering - opening a SHORT position at a price of $0.0715 - for $1500. We decided following targets: 
that we will close one half of our position when $TRYB drops 40% from our entry and the rest of the position, 
when $TRYB drops 50% from our entry.
a) What will be the Take profit points (the exit price marks)?
b) What will be our total profit (on top of the 1500$ investment)?
c) If the price action will go against us, we agreed to absorb losses of $300, 
to not to expose ourselves to bigger risk. Whats the $TRYB price then to set a stop loss - exit strategy?

SHORT
Entry price (Pex) = $0.0715
$invested (n) = $1500
1/2 position closed 40% drop from the entry
1/2 entire position 50% drop from the entry

a) exit price marks:
a1) 0.0715*0.6=0.0429
a2) 0.0715*0.5=0.03575

First take profit target is $TRYB=$0.0429 and second $TRYB=$0.03575

b) With $1500 investment, our profit will be
1500/2=750
(750*1.4)+(750*1.5)-1500
= 2175-1500
= 675

or, we know that it is half of the position at 40% and half at 50%. (40+50)/2=45%
(1500*1.45)-1500=
= 2175-1500
= 675

Our profit will be $675

or use the formula:
1500-(1500*0.6)=600 1500+600=2100=1050
1500-900=600/2
300

600+1500=2100
1500-(1500*0.5)=750/2
375

300+375=675

c) 300$ risk exposure
300/1500=0.2
0.2=20%
Our risk exposure is 20% of the investment
Do not forget we go SHORT, so against us means the price goes up.
Entry price (Pex) = $0.0715
0.0715*1.2=0.0858
We setting a stop loss price on the mark of $TRYB=$0.0858



3 - Actually I made a mistake in the excercise number 1. It is slightly a bit more complicated. We are looking 
to withraw 10000 in total, just like in the excercise number 1, but in EURO, in CASH. The market though is only 
in COPE/USD. To get it in cash, we will use an ATM. ATM takes 3.5% fee and allows only 900E withdrawls per 
transaction. Each transaction charges 10E fixwd fee on top of the 3.5% fee. If our objective is to have 10000E in cash 
in the end of this investment, what is the price to exit the COPE/USD market. Giving the anticipation that the ratio 
of USD/EUR stays the same as it's today.
